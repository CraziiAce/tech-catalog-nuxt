# Adding Light/Motion to Your Project

## Lots of projects benefit from the addition of light and/or motion. Luckily, Logan has all sorts of supplies to make adding flair to your project easy.

### For this, you will need:

#### - One [Arduino Uno](tech-catalog.vercel/app/theme3/items/b3253g6cvup2) or similar microcontroller

#### - One [9V battery pack](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/5unbkx5e8m9o).

#### - For light: At least one LED (Light Illuminated Diode). For small projects, you should use [this one](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/tag202hxtmcc). For larger projects with multiple LEDs of different colors, use the [LED kit](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/7duvp4ccv4p4). If you want a large amount of illumination with a single LED, use these [large LEDs](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/clkraigmayoe). For projects with just a tiny bit of light, use the [small LED kit](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/kwm9nwjn4xb0).

#### - For motion: One [DC motor](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/tzfrlb3cao8k) or similar motor/servo.

#### If you want to be able to toggle/turn on the motor or light, you can use a [button](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/qzec7etwowqb), [toggle switch](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/wheff8wngrr6), or [on/off switch](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/v1meqjsz7m06).

#### Depending on the complexity of your project, you may need a [breadboard](https://catalog.theloganschool.org/theme3/items/rmxg4fsgw0mc) and/or resistors/transistors.
